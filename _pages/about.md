# About Me

I am a **Predoctoral Research Fellow** at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, working in the HiRo Lab under the guidance of **Dr. Ravi Prakash** at RBCCPS. My research focuses on tackling robotics problems that integrate human feedback to improve system performance. I aim to develop robots and systems that think like humans and assist effectively in a wide range of tasks. My primary area of interest lies in designing **planning systems** that enhance human cognition and collaboration.

I completed my **Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering** from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Mandi, in 2024. During my undergraduate studies, I worked with **Dr. Laxmidhar Behera** and **Dr. Narendra Kumar Dhar** on learning long-horizon skills from human video demonstrations. I also had the opportunity to participate in two semester exchange programs at **TU Darmstadt, Germany**, and **NTNU, Norway**. At TU Darmstadt, I worked in the AIML lab under **Quentin Delfosse** and **Dr. Kristian Kersting**, focusing on explainable reinforcement learning agents.

## Collaboration Interests

I am eager to collaborate on topics that explore the intersection of robotics, human-computer interaction, and cognitive systems. Some of my key interests include:

- **Machines that think like humans**
  - Inspired by the work at the [Centre of Brains, Minds, and Machines](https://cbmm.mit.edu/), I am passionate about creating systems that emulate human-integrated planning.

- **Interfacing brains and learning-based models**
  - This includes exciting work like [LaBram](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18765).

- **Synthesizing real-world skills from unstructured data**
  - Leveraging information already available on the internet to train intelligent systems.

- **Natural language interfaces for human-machine interaction**
  - Exploring innovative ways to incorporate human preferences into machine learning models. Check out my work on *OVITA*.
